### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Abubakr Osama from Sudan and I am a Computer Science Researcher, my major areas of focus are Machine Learning, Cryptography, Human Computer Interaction & Automation in general. 

Languages I use include C++, C#, HTML & CSS & SQL, but I mainly use Python because of how versatile & intuitive it feels. 

I really enjoy exploring new ideas & thinking outside the box which is why I like to engage in alot of research & wireframe.
